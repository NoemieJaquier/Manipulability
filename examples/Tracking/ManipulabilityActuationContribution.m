function ManipulabilityActuationContribution
% No√©mie Jaquier and Leonel Rozo, 2020
%
% This code illustrates the effect of actuation contribution on the shape 
% of the manipulability ellipsoid. A weight matrix representing the maximum
% joint velocity is added to the definition of the velocity manipulability.
% The user can:
%   1. Use different weight matrices corresponding to different maximum
%   joint velocities for the robot
%   2. Display the kinematic or force manipulability ellipsoids
% 	3. Change the initial conditions
% 	4. Modify the robot kinematics by using the Robotics Toolbox
%      functionalities
%
% Note 1: The kinematic manipulability with actuation contribution can be
% computed as J*(W*W')*J', with J the Jacobian and W the weight matrix 
% representing the maximum joint velocity (as shown in the code below).
% Note 2: In order to track a manipulability ellipsoid including the
% actuation contribution, the kinematic manipulability Jacobian is computed
% as Jm_t = compute_red_manipulability_Jacobian(J, taskVar, W), with J the
% Jacobian, taskVar the indices of the task (1:2 for planar robots) and W
% the weight matrix representing the maximum joint velocity. 
%
% First run 'startup_rvc' from the robotics toolbox
